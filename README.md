## How to Contribute?

We need contributors to make sure we can quickly complete this repository and make it available for use for all GTA UG MP server developers.  At the moment we are focused on completing the Vice City Stories list and correcting any errors that may be present.

Please refer to this website (https://gtaundergroundmod.com/pages/ug-mp/documentation/skin-id/X/details) and replace `X` with the skin ID you wish to check.

Further more, the skin names are based on a pattern and keywords.

"B" means black, "W" means white
"F" means female, "M" means male
"Y" means young", "O" means old
"ST" means street, "RI" is rich, "DK" means dock worker, "TR" means tramp, "CR" means criminal, "VA" means valet

BFYST for example would be Black, Female, Young, Street
WMYVA for example would be White, Male, Young, Valet
